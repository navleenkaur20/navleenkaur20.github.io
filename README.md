### PROJECTS
#### Data Visualization and Analysis: Life Expectancy Mortality, and Disparities
 - Conducted data analysis on life expectancy and mortality trends using datasets (Expectation of Life at Birth, Death Rates by Age, Sex, and Race, and Death Rates for Major Causes of Death) with Excel and Python (Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas). 
- Found increasing life expectancy (1970-1999) with females leading, Black populations lagging, and declining infant mortality rates. Identified a negative correlation between infant mortality and life expectancy, and Mississippi as having the highest death rates.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning : Ted Talks
- Conducted exploratory data analysis and visualization on diverse datasets, including a speaker occupation dataset and a sleep health dataset.
Examined speaker occupation patterns by leveraging Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to create insightful visualizations. 

#### Sentiment Analysis Using VADER and RoBERTa : Amazon Reviews
- Developed a sentiment analysis pipeline leveraging VADER for rule-based scoring and RoBERTa for deep learning classification to analyze customer reviews. 
Visualized sentiment trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn, highlighting correlations between polarity scores and Amazon star ratings.
- Delivered actionable insights by comparing model outputs and uncovering sentiment patterns across feedback. Utilized Python, Hugging Face Transformers, and data visualization to effectively interpret unstructured textual data.
