### ACADEMIC PROJECTS

### Life Expectancy & Mortality Disparities Analysis
- Analyzed life expectancy and mortality trends from 1970 to 1999 using Python and Excel (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) to 
identify disparities across gender and race.
- Processed and visualized historical mortality datasets, revealing a 10–15% increase in life expectancy, with females leading 
by 5% and Black populations lagging by 8–12%.
- Discovered a 20% decline in infant mortality rates and identified a strong negative correlation (-0.65) between infant 
mortality and life expectancy, highlighting the impact of early-life healthcare on longevity. Provided insights to inform 
public health policies and reduce healthcare disparities, supporting initiatives to improve maternal-infant health outcomes.

### E-commerce Sales Analysis
- Preprocessed over 50,000 sales records using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to uncover sales trends, customer 
behavior, and seasonal patterns for business decision-making.
- Filtered sales data by handling 250+ missing values and formatting date columns for consistency; engineered 3 new timebased features (order month, year, day) to enhance trend analysis.
- Conducted statistical analysis over 12 months of sales data, identifying 5+ peak sales periods and seasonal patterns 
impacting revenue. Delivered visualizations that uncovered key purchasing trends, enabling data-driven strategies for 
inventory optimization and targeted marketing campaigns.

### Gold Rate Trend Analysis
- Reviewed 9,600+ records of gold price data from 1985 to 2022 across 6 currencies using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, 
Matplotlib) to identify long-term trends.
- Transformed and processed historical price data by filling 100+ missing values and performing consistency checks on 520+ 
recent records (2020–2021).
- Created visualizations, revealing an 18.14% increase in gold prices over 37 years, with notable spikes linked to global 
economic crises like the 2008 financial crash and COVID-19 pandemic. Delivered insights that can help investors, financial 
analysts, and policymakers understand market patterns and economic influences on commodity prices.
